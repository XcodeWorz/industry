# Industry14
A marketplace connecting programmers looking for jobs with companies looking to statistically find the best ones. Built as a serverless app with React &amp; Firestore.

## Goal
This was my final year university project. It allows for programmers looking for jobs to sign up, complete their profile, take tests, and get companies to apply to them. 
These tests, allow us to provide a metric based view for how good they are in their specific skill sets.

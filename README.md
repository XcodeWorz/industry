# Industry14
A marketplace connecting programmers looking for jobs with companies looking to statistically find the best ones. Built as a serverless app with React &amp; Firestore.

## Goal
This was my final year university project. This is what I wrote as an intro to my project:
> We help programmers find great companies to work at and help companies find great programmers. We test programmers on their actual coding ability, generating a statistical report on their strengths & weaknesses. This report helps companies quickly assess candidates on objective metrics rather than subjective resumes. Companies can contact, interview and extend offer letters to programmers all through our online platform.
